</div>

Boomerang brings the iPhone and iCloud to elementary OS: notifications, messages, calls,
contacts, AirPods, iCloud mail, calendars, reminders, Drive and Photos. Everything runs on your
computer. The iPhone is reached over Bluetooth, iCloud over the Internet, and nothing goes
through a server of ours.

*Boomerang was called Covalence until version 0.6. Moving to Boomerang keeps your settings,
messages and iCloud accounts.*

> **Alpha.** Version 0.8 is a public preview. It works every day on its author's computer,
> but expect rough edges. The interface is in French, with English in beta.

## Two connections

### iPhone connection (Bluetooth)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Notifications** | Every iPhone notification on the desktop, with its actions and the icon of the app that sent it. Choose which apps show up. |
| **Now Playing** | What the iPhone plays, with its cover, progress and volume, in its own page and in a mini player above Settings. Play starts the iPhone's music again even when it is stopped. |
| **Battery** | Level in the panel, alerts at 20 % and 10 %. |
| **Messages** | Read your SMS conversations, reply to one person, draft, search. Delete a message or a conversation from Boomerang (it stays on the iPhone). |
| **Phone** | Answer, decline and place calls with the computer's microphone and speakers, dial pad, call history. Needs PipeWire 1.4 or later. |
| **Contacts** | The iPhone's contacts over Bluetooth (read only), or your iCloud contacts, which you can edit. |
| **AirPods** | Battery of each bud and the case, noise control, conversation awareness, ear detection, rename. Experimental: nod to answer a call, shake your head to decline. Based on the protocol documented by LibrePods. |
| **iPhone sound** | Send the iPhone's audio to the computer from the AirPlay button, or refuse it. |

### Apple Services connection (Internet)

| | |
|---|---|
| **iCloud Mail, Calendars, Reminders, Contacts** | Added to elementary's Mail, Tasks and calendar apps through Evolution Data Server, with an app-specific password. |
| **iCloud Drive** | A folder in Files, through [rclone](https://rclone.org). |
| **iCloud Photos** | Your albums in Files, read only, through rclone. |

> **About iCloud Drive and Photos.** rclone signs in the way icloud.com does, with your Apple
> Account password and two-factor authentication. Apple does not offer this access officially:
> the iCloud terms limit automated access and allow Apple to suspend an account. It also needs
> Advanced Data Protection turned off, which reduces the end-to-end encryption of your iCloud
> data. The sign-in token expires about once a month. Use this feature at your own risk;
> Boomerang asks you to accept these risks before signing in.

## Install

### From the package (recommended)

1. Download `boomerang_0.8.1-1_amd64.deb` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/melvincouwez-alt/boomerang/releases/latest).
2. Double-click it. Eddy (elementary OS) or the App Center (Ubuntu) installs Boomerang and every
   package it needs. In a terminal: `sudo apt install ./boomerang_*.deb`.
3. Log out and back in (or run `systemctl --user start boomerangd`), then open Boomerang.
   The setup assistant guides you through pairing the iPhone and signing in to iCloud.

If something is missing later, Boomerang lists it under "Missing components" with an
"Install" button (PackageKit asks for your password). For iCloud Drive and Photos, a
"Download rclone" button fetches the official rclone build and checks its SHA-256 checksum
(`boomerangd --fetch-rclone` does the same in a terminal).

Uninstall with `sudo apt remove boomerang`. Your data stays in `~/.local/share/boomerang` and
`~/.config/boomerang` until you delete them (see [privacy](docs/privacy.md)).

### Compatibility

| System | Status |
|---|---|
| elementary OS 8 or later | Everything works. Calls need PipeWire 1.4 or later: with an older PipeWire, Boomerang greys the calls out and says why. |
| Ubuntu 24.04 or later | Needs Granite 7.7 or later. Calls need PipeWire 1.4 or later. Ubuntu 24.04 ships rclone 1.60, too old for iCloud: use the "Download rclone" button. |

Hardware: a Bluetooth adapter that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (almost all recent ones).

### From source

```sh
meson setup build --prefix=$HOME/.local
ninja -C build && meson install -C build
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now boomerangd
```

Build dependencies: `valac`, `meson`, `libgranite-7-dev` (7.7 or later), `libgtk-4-dev`.
Runtime dependencies are listed in `debian/control`. Offline tests:
`python3 -m unittest tests.test_offline`. Package: `packaging/build-deb.sh`.

## What it cannot do

Honest limits, mostly set by what an iPhone accepts from a non-Apple computer:

- No iMessage sending, no group replies, no attachments: Bluetooth only sends one-to-one SMS.
- No universal clipboard, Handoff, AirDrop or Continuity Camera: they need Apple's own
  encryption and Wi-Fi stack.
- Deleting a message only removes it from Boomerang. iOS ignores deletions over Bluetooth.
- The iPhone does not always reconnect by itself to a Bluetooth LE accessory. The
  [guide](data/guide/en/12-troubleshooting.md) explains what to do.
- Unlocking the computer with the iPhone is left out on purpose: Bluetooth signal strength
  can be faked.

## New in 0.8

Since 0.7.0:

- Messages: a conversation opens on its newest message. Each one can have its own look
  (nickname, emoji, bubble colour, background, text size) and notifications (priority, muted,
  own sound). Search in the conversation (Ctrl+F), a button back to new messages, an "Unread"
  line, custom quick replies, link previews (off by default), export to PDF or text.
- Notifications: per iPhone app (normal, priority or quiet), own sound, text hidden from the
  banner if you wish.
- Screen mirroring in a Boomerang window sized to the picture, full screen with F11, optional
  MP4 recording and an experimental Bluetooth beacon so the iPhone finds the computer.
- AirPods, experimental: nod to answer a call, shake your head to decline it.
- Contributors page under Settings: every project Boomerang relies on, with authors, licenses
  and links.
- One header bar in Boomerang's colours, left column that folds to icons (F9).
- Lighter daemon and app, new icon in the elementary style.

## Help

Boomerang has a built-in guide, in French and English (F1, or Guide in the sidebar). It walks
through pairing, the iPhone settings to turn on, iCloud, AirPods and troubleshooting.
Questions and bug reports: [Issues](https://github.com/melvincouwez-alt/boomerang/issues).

## Who makes it

I am not a developer. I am an elementary OS fan with a few ideas and an iPhone in my pocket,
and I build Boomerang by "vibe coding" with Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant: I describe what I
want, test it on my own computer every day, and we fix things together. The code is open so
that people who know better can read it, point out mistakes and help. Contributions, issues
and kind advice are very welcome.

## How it works

- **boomerangd**, the daemon (Python, PyGObject): owns the Bluetooth link and the secrets.
  It talks to the iPhone through BlueZ (ANCS and AMS over Bluetooth LE, MAP and PBAP through
  obexd, HFP through PipeWire's `org.pipewire.Telephony`), to iCloud through Evolution Data
  Server and libsecret, and runs rclone for Drive and Photos.
- **The app** (Vala, GTK 4, Granite): one window, plus separate Messages, Phone, Contacts and
  AirPods apps for the dock. It talks to the daemon over D-Bus
  (`io.github.melvincouwez.Boomerang.Daemon`).
- Logs never contain notification or message text, names or numbers.

Boomerang installs two companion apps from the Apple services tab, each published in its own
repository with its own releases: **Agenda**
([source and downloads](https://github.com/melvincouwez-alt/agenda), GPL-3.0-or-later) and **Cassette**, an
Apple Music client forked from [Sidra](https://github.com/wimpysworld/sidra) by Martin Wimpress
and built on [CastLabs Electron](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases)
([source and downloads](https://github.com/melvincouwez-alt/cassette), Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0).

Special thanks to the LibrePods team for their remarkable reverse-engineering work, and to
[nRF Connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile)
(Nordic Semiconductor), a free iPhone app that helped with the first pairings (no longer needed).
